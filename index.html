To Government Officials, Human Rights Institutions, and Policy Makers,

Iran has now been under a complete communication blackout for three days.

For over two weeks, millions of Iranians have been in the streets.  
The death toll has exceeded 2,000.  
The people are unarmed.  
The Islamic Republic is using military force against civilians.

All internet, phone, and international communication channels are shut down.  
Iranians outside the country cannot reach their families.  
Information reaches us only in fragments.  
The images that do emerge are unbearable.

This is no longer a domestic issue.  
This is a mass human rights crime in real time.

The Islamic Republic has openly declared, through its own security council, that protesters must be confronted with maximum force.  
By its own admission, it has confirmed that it has lost all legitimacy.

When a regime cuts all communication,  
when it shoots its own people,  
when it hides its crimes in darkness,  
it no longer represents a nation — it occupies it.

Iranians inside and outside Iran are naming Prince Reza Pahlavi as their political alternative.

He is recognized by the people as their political representative and the legitimate alternative to the Islamic Republic.

You are obligated — morally and politically — to engage with him.  
To coordinate with him.  
To recognize him as the voice of the Iranian people.

The Iranian people are asking for leadership, coordination, and action — not sympathy.

If you stand for democracy,  
if you stand for human rights,  
if you stand for the protection of civilian life,  
this is the moment to act.

Stand with the Iranian people.  
Not in words.  
In action.
